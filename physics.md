##article I:
 * ref: [(Iterative Dynamics with Temporal CoherenceErin Catto)](books/IterativeDynamics.pdf)
 * overview:
	 * tech used:  
	 rigid body physics (刚体)
	 * demands:
		 * build a physics engine
		 * performance -- use approximation.
		 * stability
	 * aspects:
		 * collision detection
		 * autoring (predefined rules?) -- to solve extreme mass ratio issues.

 * related work:
	 * used:
		 * time-stepping scheme
		 * velocity-based & approximate friction
	 * other angle:
		 * impulses
		 * particle model with distance constraints
	 * proposed method:
		 * penetration
